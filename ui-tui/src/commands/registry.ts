   * more entries: provider, skill and compute administration, and twins of
   * half the session commands. None of them is something you reach for while
   * talking to the agent, and a popup you scroll is one you stop reading. They
   * all still run — `cli.dispatch` accepts them, and typing one in full works
   * — but they are the CLI's surface, not this one's.

   * One source also means the popup and the gateway cannot drift: there is
