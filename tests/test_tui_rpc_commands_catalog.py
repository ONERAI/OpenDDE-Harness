"""The slash catalog offers what the gateway will actually run, and says what it is.

Reported by the owner: several entries in the slash popup were described as
"runs on the gateway" and failed when run. Both defects had one cause. The
catalog served group *heads* -- ``provider``, ``sessions``, ``skill``,
``compute``, ``protein-design`` -- which are not commands: Typer would print
the group's help, and ``cli.dispatch`` answers ``not_dispatch_compatible``. And
it served only names, so the client had nothing to describe them with.

The rule here is the dispatcher's own: an entry belongs in the catalog exactly
when ``cli.dispatch`` would accept it. There is no second list to maintain.
