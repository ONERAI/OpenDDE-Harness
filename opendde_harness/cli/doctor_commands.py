"""``ddeharness doctor`` — health check (static + optional --probe).

The static checks reach no vendor. The one child they start is the model
service, asked what it knows about the default model and closed again -- a
catalogue read, with no credential store written and no key seeded. The store is
read, though, because "is this provider signed in" has no other answer. Memory
and, when Protein Design is configured, the compute service are probed over
HTTP; without a Protein Design configuration doctor touches neither Docker nor
the network. ``--probe`` sends one chat exchange via
:func:`opendde_harness.cli._helpers.send_probe`.

Exit codes:
  0  — all green (and probe ok if requested)
  1  — static check failed (config missing / schema invalid / unresolved routing)
  2  — static checks ok but ``--probe``, memory or compute readiness failed
