"""Provider subcommands — owns the ``provider_app`` Typer instance.

A provider is named by its pi provider id, exactly as ``config.json`` files it:
``anthropic``, ``openai-codex``, ``azure-openai-responses``, or a name this
config declared for a provider of its own. An id has one spelling, so there is
nothing here that normalises a name or resolves an alias.

Lifecycle commands:

- ``provider login <id>`` — pi-ai's own OAuth sign-in, run inside the model
  service (OpenAI Codex today). The grant lands in the service's credential
  store, which is the same file it refreshes the token in.

Config subcommands:

- ``provider list``                 — the providers this config configures
- ``provider get <id>``             — current entry (secrets redacted)
- ``provider set <id> [...]``       — patch fields (--api-key, --base-url, --api, ...)
- ``provider use <id>/<model>``     — make one model the agent's default
- ``provider test <id>``            — ask the model a few tokens through the
                                      model service, the way a turn would
- ``provider reset <id>``           — remove the entry; a stored sign-in goes with it
- ``provider show <id>``            — reflect available ``--flag`` fields

Model subcommands (``provider model ...``) write one row of an entry's
``models`` list -- what the user knows about a model that no catalogue does:
the api it is served on, its context window and output ceiling, a name, a price:

- ``provider model set <id> <model> [--api openai-responses] [--context-window N] ...``

Architecture: write operations go ONLY through
:mod:`opendde_harness.config.update_providers`. Command bodies do not import
``load_config`` / ``save_config`` / provider Pydantic classes.

``commands.py`` imports :data:`provider_app` and registers it on the top-level
``app`` via ``app.add_typer(provider_app, name="provider")``.
