"""Slash command routing handlers.

Wires four RPC methods that the fork-imported hermes UI invokes but were not
previously registered, causing dogfood failures:

* ``slash.exec`` — hermes routes any *unknown* slash here
  (``ui-tui/src/app/createSlashHandler.ts:82``) expecting
  ``{output?, warning?}``. We shlex-split the command, delegate to
  ``cli.dispatch``, and map the result. **Never raises -32xxx** — failures
  arrive as ``{output: "", warning: "..."}`` so the UI's ``.then()`` branch
  consumes them (the ``.catch()`` branch would fall through to
  ``command.dispatch`` which is also unregistered).
* ``session.status`` — ``cli.dispatch(["status"])`` for the install-wide
  picture, followed by the session's own token totals, cache hit rate and
  estimated cost from the loop's usage tracker.
* ``complete.slash`` / ``complete.path`` — return empty completion lists so
  ``useCompletion.ts`` stops surfacing the "completion unavailable" red-frame
  toast on every keystroke.
