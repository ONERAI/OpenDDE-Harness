"""``cli.dispatch`` RPC handler — runs an EC CLI command in-process.

``argv`` + ``width`` + an optional ``timeout_s`` in, ``{stdout, stderr,
exit_code}`` out: any command Typer registers that is not in
``_DISPATCH_BLACKLIST`` is accepted, anything else is refused with -32015, and a
non-zero exit is reported in ``exit_code`` rather than as an error frame. Click
runs with ``standalone_mode=False`` so ``typer.Exit`` comes back as a return
value, and output is rendered through a Rich ``Console`` at the caller's width
then stripped of ANSI so the TUI's reconciler is not corrupted. Nothing can
interrupt the Typer app once its thread is running, so ``_dispatch_lock`` and
the stdout/console redirections belong to the command rather than to the
awaiting call: a timeout fails the RPC at once but hands both to ``_reap``,
which releases them only when the thread exits. A dispatch therefore waits for
the lock no longer than its own ``timeout_s``.

    Algorithm (harness-command-catalog-dynamic design.md §D7.1):

    1. Empty argv → False.
    2. Blacklist hard reject (prefix match against ``_DISPATCH_BLACKLIST``).
    3. Reflect ``ec_cli.app`` to determine whether argv resolves to a
       registered Typer command:
       - ``argv[0]`` in top-level command names → True.
       - ``argv[0]`` in subgroup names: require ``argv[1]`` in that group's
         subcommand names (incomplete invocations like ``["provider"]``
         return False). Groups whose body is a single
         ``@callback(invoke_without_command=True)`` (no subcommands) accept
         the bare group head — but ``tui`` is the only such group in EC
         and is blacklisted, so this branch is effectively reserved for
         test fakes.

    Reflection runs every call (no module-level cache). The Typer
    registered_commands / registered_groups walks are dict-iteration on
    small lists (<50 entries), microsecond cost; caching would create
    invalidation surface that fights the slash_routing tests that
    monkeypatch ``ec_cli.app``.

        >>> _is_dispatch_compatible(["provider", "list", "--verbose"])  # prefix args
